# Helping-Hand

This is our Skill Development project - 3. This was created in the 5th semester of our college. This is a web application which intends to give a platform to the tribal artisans to sell their products directly to the customers without having to deal with any third party vendors. We have two apps, one for the admin and one for the customers. More detailed description are given below.

## Modules

There are two modules in this project, the first one is user module and the other is admin module. <br />
The project is divided into three branches: 

- Client Side (React) - https://github.com/Audacity21/Helping-Hand/tree/client
- Admin Side (React) - https://github.com/Audacity21/Helping-Hand/tree/admin-app
- Server (Spring boot) - https://github.com/Audacity21/Helping-Hand/tree/server
